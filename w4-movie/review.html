                <p><em>The Mask of Zorro</em> is a beautiful movie, it's action, romance, and espionage combined. It has sword fights between expertly trained actors. It has well written romance and family drama. And the story is perfectly paced. Antonio Banderas was a perfect casting choice for the new Zorro and his development throughout the movie was great. The villains were casted very well too, they give a great performance and enhance the movie even more. Overall I would give it a 10/10, five stars.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>At the end, when Zorro confronts Captain Love, he pulls out his sword, and the sun glints off the blade running the full length. This was not CGI, and was suggested by Antonio Banderas. He had to tilt the sword to catch the sun without breaking eye contact with Matt Letscher. It only took three takes.</li>
                        <li>Antonio Banderas was extremely adamant about performing many of his own stunts for authenticity.</li>
                        <li>Legendary sword trainer Bob Anderson, who trained Errol Flynn, remarked that Antonio Banderas was the most gifted swordsman with whom he had worked since Flynn. Banderas had also trained with the Spanish Olympic team for four months.</li>
